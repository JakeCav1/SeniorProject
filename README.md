- [x] Add `validate`, `list-rules`, and `scan` commands.
- [x] Read JSON Lines from files or stdin and emit JSON or text alerts.
- [x] Define script-friendly exit codes and bounded input handling.
- [x] Include two demonstration rules and three sample events.
- [x] Test the engine, CLI, SSH adapters, correlation, checkpoint recovery, and monitor lifecycle.
- [x] Support rule exclusions (`none`) and optional case-insensitive matching.
- [x] Load multiple rule files or folders and detect duplicate IDs across files.
- [x] Select rules by ID for scans and list rule metadata as JSON Lines.

## Download a build

The CI workflow packages native Windows, Linux, and macOS executables with rules, sample events, documentation, and checksums. Rust is not required to run a downloaded build. See the [download guide](docs/downloads.md) for choosing an architecture, finding artifacts, and running the demo. These are unsigned development snapshots with a 14-day artifact retention period.

## Linux installation

Build on Linux and install into your user account:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked
python3 scripts/install-linux.py
```

Add `$HOME/.local/bin` to your PATH if needed. Add `--service` to write an optional systemd user-service file; it remains disabled and stopped. See the [installation guide](docs/linux-install.md) for startup, upgrades, journal access, and removal.

## Live Linux monitoring

On a Linux host with systemd journal access:

```sh
chompedr monitor
```

This uses built-in SSH rules, includes the last 60 seconds on first start, then follows new records. Checkpoints default to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/chomp-edr/ssh` or `$HOME/.local/state/chomp-edr/ssh`. Stop with Ctrl+C and run the same command to resume. Alerts are JSON on stdout; lifecycle messages and collector diagnostics go to stderr.

Use `monitor --once` to catch up and exit, `--checkpoint DIRECTORY` to choose state storage, or `-r FILE` to choose rules. This command must run in the system terminal, outside the interactive Chomp prompt. On Windows/macOS, use `scan` with exported logs. See the [monitor guide](docs/ssh-demo.md#managed-monitor-command) for limitations.

### Check monitoring progress

```sh
chompedr monitor --status
```

Status reports checkpoint use, saved progress, queued alerts, and the last correlation timestamp as JSON. It does not start collection or alter progress. Use the same `--checkpoint` and `-r` options as your monitor. It is also available inside the interactive prompt as `monitor --status`. A checkpoint lock is not a collector-health guarantee.

## Restart recovery

`scan --input-format journal --checkpoint DIRECTORY` saves detection windows and journal progress. Restart with input that includes the saved cursor. JSON alerts carry stable IDs for retry deduplication. See the [recovery guide](docs/ssh-demo.md#restart-recovery-journal-json-only) for commands and delivery limits.

## Linux journal support

Use `scan --input-format journal` or `normalize-ssh --input-format journal` with JSON Lines from `journalctl`. The [SSH walkthrough](docs/ssh-demo.md) includes the live pipeline command and the isolated Linux integration test. The journal adapter uses process metadata to identify SSH records; automatic service installation remains out of scope.

## SSH detection

Run `chompedr scan -r rules/ssh.yaml -i examples/ssh-demo.log --input-format ssh -f text` from the project folder. The demo emits two alerts. See [the SSH walkthrough](docs/ssh-demo.md) for supported log formats, normalization, threshold semantics, and Linux pipeline usage.

Loading the entire `rules` directory now includes threshold rules and requires timestamps on JSON input. Use `-r rules/starter.yaml` to retain stateless scanning without timestamps.

## Quick start

The main command is now `chompedr`. Running it without arguments shows the Chomp EDR title, ASCII gator, version, and available commands, then stays in an interactive `chompedr>` prompt. Type commands without the executable name. Use `exit` or `quit` to return to the system shell; EOF also closes the session. It does not start a background monitor. The original `chomp` command remains available for compatibility.

```sh
chompedr
chompedr scan -r rules -i examples/events.jsonl -f text
```

Inside the prompt, try `validate -r rules`, `list-rules -r rules`, or `scan -r rules -i examples/events.jsonl -f text`. `help` lists commands. Commands run one at a time and rules reload on each command. Failed commands report errors without closing the session. Quote paths containing spaces with single or double quotes; backslashes remain literal. Shell operators, variable expansion, and command execution are not supported. Interactive scans require `-i FILE`, because the prompt owns stdin; use the existing one-line scan command from the system shell for piped events. Each command line is limited to 8 KiB; exceeding that limit ends the session with an error.

The banner appears only when no arguments are supplied. Scans, JSON output, `--help`, and `--version` remain free of the banner. Rule and event paths are relative to the current directory; the startup screen works from any directory.

Install stable Rust with Cargo, then run these commands from the repository root:

```sh
cargo build --locked
cargo run -- validate --rules rules/starter.yaml
cargo run -- list-rules --rules rules/starter.yaml
cargo run -- scan --rules rules/starter.yaml --input examples/events.jsonl
cargo run -- scan --rules rules/starter.yaml --input examples/events.jsonl --format text
```

The sample has one benign event and two matching events. JSON output contains two alerts, one each for `CHOMP-001` and `CHOMP-002`.

To install both `chompedr` and the compatible `chomp` command with Cargo (ensure Cargo's bin directory is on PATH):

```sh
cargo install --path . --locked
chompedr
cat examples/events.jsonl | chomp scan -r rules/starter.yaml > alerts.jsonl
```

PowerShell piping also works:

```powershell
Get-Content examples/events.jsonl | chomp scan -r rules/starter.yaml
```

For the local Windows demo, the release executable can also be installed in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ChompEDR\bin` and that directory added to the user's PATH. After a PATH change, restart existing terminal applications so they inherit the updated value. Rebuild and reinstall after source changes to update the installed executable.

## CLI contract

- `validate -r PATH [-r PATH ...]`: validate all rule sources, including disabled rules and regex patterns.
- `list-rules -r PATH [-r PATH ...] [-f text|json]`: list rule metadata; text is the default. JSON emits one object per rule with `id`, `name`, `description`, `severity`, and `enabled`.
- `scan -r PATH [-r PATH ...] [--rule ID ...] [-i FILE|-] [-f json|text] [--fail-on-alert]`: stream JSON Lines from a file or stdin (the default).
- `--help` and `--version` are available. No administrator permissions required.

Each `-r` accepts one file or a directory. Directories load immediate regular `.yaml`/`.yml` files, case-insensitively by extension, in sorted path order; nested directories and symlink entries are ignored. Explicit file arguments may use any extension. Sources are processed in argument order, and repeated canonical file paths are loaded once. Empty rule directories, invalid files, and duplicate rule IDs across different files are errors. All loaded rules are validated before selection or event processing.

Repeat `--rule ID` to scan only those exact IDs. Unknown IDs are errors; repeated IDs do not duplicate alerts, and disabled rules stay disabled. Without `--rule`, all enabled rules are used. Selection preserves source order.

```sh
chomp validate -r rules
chomp list-rules -r rules --format json
chomp scan -r rules --rule CHOMP-002 -i examples/events.jsonl --fail-on-alert
# Load your own additional file alongside the starter rules:
chomp scan -r rules -r /path/to/custom.yaml -i examples/events.jsonl
```

Scan stdout contains alerts only; errors go to stderr. JSON is the default output and contains `rule_id`, `rule_name`, `severity`, and the original `event`. Redirect stdout to save alerts for downstream ingestion; SIEM-specific field mapping is not implemented. Each input event is flushed promptly for pipelines. Text output escapes rule strings to avoid terminal control sequences.

Exit codes: **0** for successful processing; **1** for a successful scan with detections when `--fail-on-alert` is set; **2** for argument, configuration, input, or output errors. A closed downstream pipe is treated as normal completion. Blank lines are ignored. Malformed events stop processing with a line number; alerts already written remain valid but represent only the successfully read prefix. Check the exit status before treating a scan as complete.

Rule files and individual input lines are limited to 1 MiB (line size includes line endings). Files are streamed one event at a time. The reusable library itself expects callers to enforce input size limits.

## Event contract

Every line must be a JSON object. Collectors should produce nested objects such as:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-09-17T12:00:00Z","host":"lab-host","event":{"type":"process_start"},"process":{"pid":102,"executable":"/tmp/demo"}}
```

Timestamp and host are recommended, but not required by the engine. It preserves event fields without generating timestamps or host identifiers. Raw syslog, auditd, and journal text need collector/normalization adapters before scanning.

## Rule format (version 1)

```yaml
version: 1
rules:
  - id: CUSTOM-001
    name: Shell process observed
    description: Optional explanation
    severity: low
    enabled: true
    detection:
      all:
        - field: event.type
          op: equals
          value: process_start
        - field: process.executable
          op: regex
          value: '/(bash|sh)$'
          ignore_case: true
      none:
        - field: user.name
          op: equals
          value: approved-automation
```

Each rule needs a unique, nonblank `id`, a nonblank `name`, a severity (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`), and at least one condition. `enabled` defaults to true. Unknown configuration fields, unsupported versions, duplicate IDs, and invalid regex patterns fail validation.

`all` requires every listed condition. `any` requires at least one listed condition. When both are nonempty, both groups must pass. At least one positive condition in `all` or `any` is required. Optional `none` suppresses the rule if any listed exclusion matches; an empty `none` imposes no constraint. A missing or mistyped exclusion field does not suppress an alert. Every enabled matching rule emits one alert per event, in source order.

| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `equals` | Exact string equality |
| `contains` | Literal substring |
| `starts_with` / `ends_with` | Literal prefix / suffix |
| `regex` | Rust regex search; use `^` and `$` for a full match |
| `exists` | Field is present and non-null; omit `value` |

Comparisons default to case-sensitive and require a nonempty string `value`; quote numeric-looking YAML values. Set `ignore_case: true` on a string comparison to use the regex engine's Unicode-aware case-insensitive matching. Literal comparisons still treat regex metacharacters literally. `exists` rejects `ignore_case: true`. Regex inline flags may override the rule-level setting within that pattern.

Fields use dotted object paths (`process.executable`). Missing fields, nulls, and non-string values fail comparisons. No implicit conversion, array indexing, literal dotted keys, or numeric comparison is supported yet. Optional threshold rules support time-window correlation; see [SSH detection](docs/ssh-demo.md). Regexes compile once when loading rules; lookaround and backreferences are not supported by the Rust regex engine. Existing version 1 rules keep their behavior when the new fields are omitted.

## Architecture and scope

`src/lib.rs` owns rule parsing, validation, compilation, and pure event evaluation. `src/main.rs` handles arguments, bounded streaming input, formatting, and exit codes. This boundary lets future UNIX collectors call the same engine without going through the CLI.

This release scans supplied events or supported SSH log records and correlates threshold matches across event-time windows. External shell pipelines can supply appended log records. It does not install a live collector, kill processes, isolate hosts, or execute rule-defined commands. The starter and SSH rules demonstrate the schema and can flag legitimate activity; they are not a validated production detection set.

The source uses portable Rust APIs. CI is configured for Linux, macOS, and Windows; actual compatibility should be confirmed by successful runs on each platform. UNIX-specific endpoint collection remains future work.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
```

Tests cover operators, missing/mistyped fields, all/any/none semantics, case-insensitive literals and regexes, disabled rules, invalid configuration, deterministic multi-rule alerts, cross-file duplicates, atomic ID selection, sorted directory loading, JSON rule listing, CLI file/stdin input, JSON output, error codes, CRLF, and event size limits. Dependencies are recorded in `Cargo.lock`.

Next milestones: live Linux verification and broader log support; tuning against representative real activity; explicit response policy and audited response actions.
